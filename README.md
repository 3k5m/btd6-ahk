# Bloons TD 6 with AutoHotkey v2  

An AutoHotkey v2 script for Bloons TD 6 to help during collection events. Plays through expert maps
on easy, standard difficulty with the collection bonus active or Dark Castle when no collection
event is active.  

The most likely reason for the script to break and get stuck is a level up. In most cases even this
should only result as a single defeat but you may need to finish the current game and restart the
script manually.

## Requirements:
- _Full monkey knowledge (the script has only been tested with all knowledge on)_  
- Game running **fullscreen** on a **1920x1080** display  
- **Benjamin** selected as the Hero  
- Game language set to **English**  
- _All expert maps unlocked (?)_  
- **Default game hotkeys**  
- [AutoHotkey v2.0](https://www.autohotkey.com/)

### Note on the display resolution
You can change the display resolution to 1920x1080 in **_Windows settings_** if
you have a higher resolution display. Setting the resolution in the game
settings is not enough altough that must also be set correctly.

## Usage
Start the script on the home menu, stage selection menu, collection menu, or in an expert
easy/standard map, using the hotkey _Ctrl + Alt + Shift + J_.  

The script can be stopped (and reloaded) by pressing _Ctrl + Alt + Shift + P_.
